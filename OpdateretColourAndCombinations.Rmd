For further explanation of the JSON format see - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp

Lets take a look at the first six data entries after we extracted the list from the initial response:
```{r}
golden_paintings %>% 
  head()
```
By shuffling through the columns (use the little black arrow at the top of the data frame) we see that some of the rows contain data frames and lists within themselves - this dataframe is a complex one.In order to tidy up the data, we can use the R-library 'tidyverse'. 
The tidy format is defined as:

> In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.

[*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)

# Tidying the data
Because handling this complex dataframe could be a workshop in itself, we have decided to give you a prewritten function that turns our 996 observations of 70 variables complex dataframe into a simple one of 996 observations of 15 variables. We have done this to keep you focused on being introduced to a way of interacting witha digital collection in this workshop. Just notice that we simplified the data a lot in this step and that your idea for analysis probably is possible with a different way of dataprocessing. But for now we use the predefined function `SMK_dataframe()`

```{r}
SMK_dataframe(golden_paintings) -> golden_paintings
```


# How the computer understand pictures
We now have the relevant data, but before we venture into the digital analysis of images we need to  briefly address some key concepts that will help us understand what happens in the next steps.

The first concepts might not come as a surprise to many: pixels. Digital pictures consist of pixels. The more pixel - the better the quality of the picture. Each pixel has a color. But what are colors to a computer? Most people know the primary colours as red, yellow and green. Some people might want to include green to the primary colours. This all depends on what colour theory they were taught in school. There are several colour theories and especially if we include the historical ones. This rabbit hole of colour theories is without the scope of this project. Here we restrict ourselves to how the computer understands colors when it is going to show them on a screen. In this case the computer uses the RGB color model. Here the computer creates a specific colour for a pixel by storing a numeric value for the Red- Green- and Blue-channel. These numerical values can appear in several forms of [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#Numeric_representations), but here we will focus on the digital [8-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing) per channel representation. This means that each color channel can assume the value from 0 to 255.  
Since it can be inconvenient to store and handle colours in triplets of numeric values we also have the [hexidecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) representation of the RGB-colors. Many people might be familiar with hex colour codes, but never really thought about that they were representations of RGB-colour.  

The color code for green could in the two formats would be like this:
>RGB Decimal: 0, 255, 0

>Hex:00ff00

In a less generic example we demonstrate both pixels and color code in the visualisation beneath of the painting *Interiør med en ung pige, der fletter sit hår* by Anna Ancher:
![Pixels and their colorcodes](../graphics/a_ancher_girl_interior_pixel_color.png)

To sum up we now know the following about digital pictures: It consists of pixels that each stores numerical information of their colours. Next up we are going to extract the colours from a picture and see which colours are predominant within a picture. We will both be handling RGB-decimal and hex colours codes. 

# Udsigt fra Dosseringen ved Sortedamssøen mod Nørrebro	

We know from AfkodKunsten.Rmd that *Udsigt fra Dosseringen ved Sortedamssøen mod Nørrebro* by Christen Købke is SMK's most exhibited golden age painting. So let's use this as a case. First we need to find the image thumbnail:
```{r}
golden_paintings %>% 
  filter(title == "Udsigt fra Dosseringen ved Sortedamssøen mod Nørrebro") %>% 
  select(title, image_thumbnail)
```

Next step is to let R read the thumbnail link to the particular picture. Here we use the function `load.image()`, from the imager-package. The function can read images into R and either from a file on your computer or by URL, which is the case here: 

```{r}
view_dosseringen <- load.image("https://iip-thumb.smk.dk/iiif/jp2/KMSKMS359.tif.reconstructed.tif.jp2/full/!1024,/0/default.jpg")
```


When we just write the name of the new element will give us some metadata 
```{r}
view_dosseringen
```
We see the dimensions of the image, the depth refers to how many layers there are in the picture. If it is above 1 the file is actually a video. The colour channels refers to the RGB-values explained earlier.


To see the actual picture we need to plot it:
```{r}
plot(view_dosseringen)
```

The next step is to simplify the image. This is because there is a lot of unique colours in the picture. Trying to quantise and summarise the picture in most cases would result in only seeing different tones of the "same" colour. In this case we are interested in creating a summarised version of the images based on the pixels individual hex-values. By using the hexidecimal system it can be around 16 million possible colours! - Therefore we need to simplify it. First by converting the image to the Magick-format. This format has the function of reducing the number of unique colours to a number of your liking - here we choose 20. Before that however we also simplify the image by reducing it's width to 500

```{r}
view_dosseringen %>% 
  cimg2magick() %>% 
  image_resize("500") %>% 
  image_quantize(max=20,  colorspace = "sRGB")
```
In the step above we also change the colorspace to [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB), which is a standard of denoting RGB-values created by Microsoft and HP in 1996 to use on computer screens and on the internet. 

The next step is to convert the image into the Cimg format used by the Imager-functions.
```{r}
view_dosseringen %>% 
  cimg2magick() %>% 
  image_resize("500") %>% 
  image_quantize(max=20,  colorspace = "sRGB") %>% 
  magick2cimg()
```

It is a bit hard to see what difference this actually did. So let's save it to an element:
```{r}
view_dosseringen %>% 
  cimg2magick() %>% 
  image_resize("500") %>% 
  image_quantize(max=20, colorspace = "sRGB") %>% 
  magick2cimg() -> view_dosseringen_img
```

This appears in the environment as a Large cimg consisting of 543000 elements. We can also examine it with the `dim()`-function

```{r}
dim(view_dosseringen_img)
```

And how large is the element? 
```{r}
length(view_dosseringen_img)
```


As mentioned 543000 elements. This is because all the pixels in our pictures is stored with the rgb-value. Remember that our picture right now is 500x362 pixels. So our picture consists
of:


```{r}
500*362
```

181000 pixels! But each of these pixels will have three values with them, the red, green and blue value: 

```{r}
181000*3
```
So that's the reason our picture consists of 543000 elements. To better work with these values we will convert the view_dosseringen_img to a dataframe, where we get the one pixel per row with the coordinates and rgb-vaules as variables: 

```{r}
view_dosseringen_img %>% 
  as.data.frame(wide = "c") %>% 
  rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3)
```



The next step is to convert the sRGB-values to a hex-code in order to have a simpler representation of colours and one we can work with and visualise in R: 

```{r}
view_dosseringen_img %>% 
  as.data.frame(wide = "c") %>% 
  rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3) %>% 
  mutate(hex = rgb(R, G, B))
```
This makes it easy to count the most used colors in the picture:

```{r}
view_dosseringen_img %>% 
  as.data.frame(wide = "c") %>% 
  rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3) %>% 
  mutate(hex = rgb(R, G, B)) %>% 
  count(hex, sort = TRUE)
```
But counts aren't really good for saying anything general. Let's calculate the frequency instead. This is fairly easy since we know that there is a total of 181000 pixels in the image of the painting:

```{r}
view_dosseringen_img %>% 
  as.data.frame(wide = "c") %>% 
  rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3) %>% 
  mutate(hex = rgb(R, G, B)) %>% 
  count(hex, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(freq = n / (length(view_dosseringen_img)/3))
```


But these hex codes are for machines and not human eyes! Lets visualise the dispersion of colours with colors!! First we save the above count to a new dataframe:
```{r}
view_dosseringen_img %>% 
  as.data.frame(wide = "c") %>% 
  rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3) %>% 
  mutate(hex = rgb(R, G, B)) %>% 
  count(hex, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(freq = n / (length(view_dosseringen_img)/3)) -> dosseringen_color_freq
```


Now we can put the data into a plot, in order to visualise the different colors: 

```{r}
DosseringenColour <-  dosseringen_color_freq %>% 
  pull(hex)
names(DosseringenColour) <- dosseringen_color_freq %>% 
  pull(hex)


dosseringen_color_freq %>%
mutate(hex = reorder(hex, n)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = hex, y = freq, fill = hex)) +
  geom_col() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = DosseringenColour) + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Hex color",
      y = "Frequnecy",
      title = "Colour dispersion in percentage after resizing and image quantizing the painting\n*Udsigt fra Dosseringen ved Sortedamssøen mod Nørrebro*") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 14, hjust = 1), legend.position="none")
```

# Comparing images 

To save ourselves some time we wrapped the initial pictures processing steps into a single function. So below we define a function that:
1. loads the picture
2. converts it into the Magick-format 
3. resizes it to 500 pixels in width
4. reduces the number of unique colours in the picture to 10
5. converts the format back to cimg
6. changes the cimg format to a data frame with the coordinates of the pictures and the corresponding hex-value


```{r}
PicToTible <- function(pic){
   load.image(pic) %>% 
    cimg2magick() %>% 
    image_resize("500") %>% 
    image_quantize(max = 10) %>% 
    magick2cimg() %>% 
    as.data.frame(wide = "c") %>% 
    rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3) %>% 
    mutate(hex = rgb(R, G, B))
}
```

From AfkodKunsten.Rmd we know that second most displayed artwork is *Sjællandsk landskab. Åben egn i det nordlige Sjælland* by Johan Thomas Lundbye. Let's try and compare the color palettes of this artwork and of our view from Dosseringen. First we filter out *Sjællands landskab* in order to get the URL. 

```{r}
golden_paintings %>% 
  filter(title == "Sjællandsk landskab. Åben egn i det nordlige Sjælland")
```

The next step is to use our function from before and convert our picture into a tibble with the pixels, their coordinates and hex value  - to that we add the metadata: author and title.:

```{r}
PicToTible("https://iip-thumb.smk.dk/iiif/jp2/8g84mn026_KMSKMS402.tif.jp2/full/!1024,/0/default.jpg") %>% 
  mutate(creator = "Lundbye, Johan Thomas", title = "Sjællandsk landskab. Åben egn i det nordlige Sjælland") -> landscape
```

Same procedure for *Udsigt fra Dosseringen ved Sortedamssøen* :
```{r}
PicToTible("https://iip-thumb.smk.dk/iiif/jp2/KMSKMS359.tif.reconstructed.tif.jp2/full/!1024,/0/default.jpg") %>% 
  mutate(creator = "Købke, Christen", title = "Udsigt fra Dosseringen ved Sortedamssøen mod Nørrebro") -> dosseringen
```
Since "landscape" and "dosseringen" have the exact same columns it is fairly easy to combine these two dataframes into one. This makes the comparison easier later. This is achieved with the function `bind_rows()` and assigned to a new element:

```{r}
comp_landscape_w_dossering <- bind_rows(dosseringen, landscape)
```

The next step is to count the pixels on title and hex:

```{r}
comp_landscape_w_dossering %>% 
  count(title, hex, sort = TRUE)
```
This gives us the most frequent colours within the two pictures - but we can't compare them! The problem is that we don't know the total amount of pixels within and thus #56503B from *Sjællands Landskab* takes the first place only because that there simply are more pixels in this picture. Therefore, we need to calculate the frequency, but before we do that we need to find the total amount of pixels within each picture.  This is done in the next step and we add this to a new dataframe: 
```{r}
comp_landscape_w_dossering %>% 
  count(title, hex, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) -> total_colors
```

The next step is to add this information into the data frame before and calculate the frequency: 
```{r}
comp_landscape_w_dossering %>% 
  count(title, hex, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  left_join(total_colors, by = "title") %>% 
  mutate(freq = n / total) -> comp_freq
```

Let's see what that actually did: 
```{r}
comp_freq
```
So just to validate that we actually calculated the frequencies within each work, let's sum on the freq column. That should return 1 for each work:
```{r}
comp_freq %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  summarise(freq_sum = sum(freq))
```
Quite right! 

Next step is to visualise the color-pallets of the two works next to each other. We use the same method as before - more or less: 

```{r}
library(forcats)

CompColour <-  comp_freq %>% 
  pull(hex)
names(CompColour) <- comp_freq %>% 
  pull(hex)

comp_freq %>%
  group_by(title) %>%
  slice_max(freq, n = 15) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(freq, fct_reorder(hex, freq), fill = hex)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = CompColour) + 
  facet_wrap(~title, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "freq", y = NULL)
```

Let's see the two pictures next to eachother: 

```{r, include=FALSE}
dosseringen_mgck <- load.image("https://iip-thumb.smk.dk/iiif/jp2/KMSKMS359.tif.reconstructed.tif.jp2/full/!1024,/0/default.jpg") %>% cimg2magick() %>% image_resize("300") %>% image_quantize(max = 10)

landscape_mgck <- load.image("https://iip-thumb.smk.dk/iiif/jp2/8g84mn026_KMSKMS402.tif.jp2/full/!1024,/0/default.jpg") %>% cimg2magick() %>%  image_resize("300") %>% image_quantize(max = 10)

img <- c(landscape_mgck, dosseringen_mgck)

img <- image_scale(img, "300x300")

image_append(image_scale(img, "x300"))
```

With human eyes we can see that there is a difference between the two pictures. For example in terms of colour-tones


# Comparing entire oeuvres 
Who could be cool to compare?: 

```{r}
golden_paintings %>% 
  filter(!is.na(saturation)) %>% 
  count(creator_1, sort = TRUE)
```

In this exercise we will work with Skovgaard because there are 19 images, and that is easier to download than 73 images. However, 19 images is also too much for human eyes to comprehend. 


```{r}
thumb_urls <- golden_paintings %>% 
  filter(!is.na(saturation)) %>% 
  filter(creator_1 == "Skovgaard, P.C.") %>%  
  pull(image_thumbnail)

picture_mgk <- NULL

oeuvre <- NULL

for (url in thumb_urls)
  {picture_mgk <- load.image(url) %>% 
                    cimg2magick() %>% 
                    image_resize("500")
  
  oeuvre <- append(ouevre, picture_mgk)}
```


```{r}
oeuvre
```



```{r}
oeuvre <- image_scale(ouevre, "300x300")

image_append(image_scale(ouevre, "x300")) -> ouevre
```


```{r}
ouevre
```


```{r}
8244 * 300
```


```{r}
ouevre %>% 
    image_quantize(max = 20) %>% 
    magick2cimg() %>% 
    as.data.frame(wide = "c") %>% 
    rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3) %>% 
    mutate(hex = rgb(R, G, B)) -> ouevre_colors
```

```{r}
ouevre_colors %>% 
  count(hex, sort = TRUE) -> ouevre_count
```


```{r}
OuevreColour <-  ouevre_count %>% 
  pull(hex)
names(OuevreColour) <- ouevre_count %>% 
  pull(hex)


ouevre_count %>%
mutate(hex = reorder(hex, n)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = hex, y = n, fill = hex)) +
  geom_col() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = OuevreColour) + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Hex color",
      y = "Count",
      title = "Ouevre of P.C. Skovgaard works within SMK") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 14, hjust = 1), legend.position="none") 
```
